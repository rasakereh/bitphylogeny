We've provided a sample data file 'sample_data.csv' in the folder. To run the sample file, execute the following code. 

python bitphylogeny 'sample_data.csv' 'output' 200, 100, 1 

'sample_data.csv': the data file
'output': the output folder where the MCMC traces and tree scripts are stored.
200: number of mcmc samples in total 
100: number of burn-in samples
1: thin number (a current requirement is number of mcmc samples / thin > 5)
