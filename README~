This README file discusses the code associated with the manuscript:
Ke Yuan, Thomas Sakoparnig, Florian Markowetz and Niko Beerenwinkel. 
BitPhylogeny: A probabilistic framework for reconstructing intra-tumor phylogenies

The Python code is based on the implementation from 
Ryan Prescott Adams, Zoubin Ghahramani and Michael I. Jordan.
Tree-Structured Stick Breaking for Hierarchical Data. NIPS 2010.

Dependencies:
NumPy
SciPy
scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 

We've provided a sample data file 'sample_data.csv' in the folder. To run the sample file, execute the following code. 

python bitphylogeny 'sample_data.csv' 'output' 200, 100, 5 

'sample_data.csv': the data file
'output': the output folder where the MCMC traces and tree scripts are stored.
200: number of mcmc samples in total 
100: number of burn-in samples
5: thin number (a current requirement is number of mcmc samples / thin > 5)

To compute the MPEAR summrized label and corresponding v-measures execute the following code from the post-process/ folder.

sh post_process.sh '../output/data_sample.csv/' '../data_sample.csv' 

'../output/data_sample.csv/': the folder which contains mcmc-traces and tree
'../data_sample.csv': the data file

The code generates a pdf file of the v-measure porfile under '../output/data_sample.csv/'


Others:
The data folder has all the data in the paper
The baseline folder contains the implementation of the baseline methods described in the paper.
