  title = {Tree-Structured Stick Breaking Processes for Hierarchical Data},
  year = {2010},
  month = jun,
  abstract = {Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure.
	In this paper we propose a flexible nonparametric prior over unknown
	data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes
	to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live
	at any node and are infinitely exchangeable. One can view our model
	as providing infinite mixtures where the components have a dependency
	structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree.
	By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte
	Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference
	and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our
	method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of
	text data.},

  abstract = {Neoplasms are thought to progress to cancer through genetic instability
	generating cellular diversity and clonal expansions driven by selection
	for mutations in cancer genes. Despite advances in the study of molecular
	biology of cancer genes, relatively little is known about evolutionary
	mechanisms that drive neoplastic progression. It is unknown, for
	example, which may be more predictive of future progression of a
	neoplasm: genetic homogenization of the neoplasm, possibly caused
	by a clonal expansion, or the accumulation of clonal diversity. Here,
	in a prospective study, we show that clonal diversity measures adapted
	from ecology and evolution can predict progression to adenocarcinoma
	in the premalignant condition known as Barrett's esophagus, even
	when controlling for established genetic risk factors, including
	lesions in TP53 (p53; ref. 6) and ploidy abnormalities. Progression
	to cancer through accumulation of clonal diversity, on which natural
	selection acts, may be a fundamental principle of neoplasia with
	important clinical implications.},

  abstract = {All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer
	genomes reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer
	cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms
	further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast
	cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures
	of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide
	substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2
	mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution
	mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex
	relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription
	were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation,
	termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between
	cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base
	substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine
	at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational
	signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of
	cytidine deaminases is proposed.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in next generation sequencing have made it possible
	to precisely characterize all somatic coding mutations that occur
	during the development and progression of individual cancers. Here
	we used these approaches to sequence the genomes (>43-fold coverage)
	and transcriptomes of an oestrogen-receptor-alpha-positive metastatic
	lobular breast cancer at depth. We found 32 somatic non-synonymous
	coding mutations present in the metastasis, and measured the frequency
	of these somatic mutations in DNA from the primary tumour of the
	same patient, which arose 9 years earlier. Five of the 32 mutations
	(in ABCB11, HAUS3, SLC24A4, SNX4 and PALB2) were prevalent in the
	DNA of the primary tumour removed at diagnosis 9 years earlier, six
	(in KIF1C, USP28, MYH8, MORC1, KIAA1468 and RNASEH2A) were present
	at lower frequencies (1-13\%), 19 were not detected in the primary
	tumour, and two were undetermined. The combined analysis of genome
	and transcriptome data revealed two new RNA-editing events that recode
	the amino acid sequence of SRP9 and COG3. Taken together, our data
	show that single nucleotide mutational heterogeneity can be a property
	of low or intermediate grade primary breast cancers and that significant
	evolution can occur with disease progression.},

  abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined
	by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene
	amplification, represent approximately 16\% of all breast cancers.
	Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these
	cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution,
	with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in
	a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic
	mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that
	only approximately 36\% of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing
	measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we
	determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour
	subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases
	representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely
	in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal
	subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although
	p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem
	to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours
	their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations
	in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower
	clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour
	progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding
	the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will
	require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},
